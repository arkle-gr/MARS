# Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Workflow Scheduling in Hybrid Clouds with Privacy and Security (MARS)
This is an implementation code for our paper entitled MARS: Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Workflow Scheduling in Hybrid Clouds with Privacy and Security Constraints in IJCAI 2024.

## Requirements

see in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/arkle-gr/MARS/blob/main/requirements.txt)

install packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Quick Start

```
$ python main.py
```

Directly run the `main.py`, the approach will run with the default settings.

## Data
Workflows data with .xml format located in folder [XML_Scientific_Workflow](https://github.com/arkle-gr/MARS/tree/main/XML_Scientific_Workflow), including CyberShake, Epigenomics, LIGO, Montage, and SIPHT.

## Code Structure
- `agent.py`: the agent in MARS
- `buffer.py`:
